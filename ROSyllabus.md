::: {#BLURB .SYLSEC}
Course Description
------------------

Emphasizes concepts and methods of organizing information resources
across different settings and systems, or within one particular setting.
The course extends the basic conceptual foundation provided in LIS 501
by providing further reading, analysis, discussion, and practice related
to one or several major traditions of information organization in
different environments (e.g., libraries, museums, archives, Internet,
and within a single organization).

::: {#PREREQUISITES .SYLSUBSEC}
### Pre- and Co-requisites

Students are strongly urged to complete LIS501 before enrolling in this
course.

::: {#WELCOME .SYLSEC}
Course overview and welcome
---------------------------

I am very happy to welcome you to LIS590-RO, and to express my strong
desire to make this a useful and productive course for you. Many of you
are enrolling soon after completing the required core class on
information organization and access. Despite the generality of my
course\'s title and description, you have chosen to join RO rather than
one of its more specialized IO/KR siblings. Job ads in our professions
read like laundry lists of specialized skills, even at the best of
times. Even more so in times of economic stress, I think your choice of
a principles class shows courage and a recognition of the importance of
taking the long view of your professional career. I congratulate you,
and promise that I will work hard to justify your faith.

Descriptive standards and practices are undergoing reforms, both for
familiar library resources and other types not traditionally associated
with our stewardship. We see new cataloging principles being proposed,
and harsh criticisms leveled against metadata standards widely viewed as
new and promising only a short time ago. Responding, adapting, and even
helping to frame these kinds of reforms will be a part of your working
life for the rest of your career. Rather than delving into the
particulars of the current debates, this course aims to equip you to
form your own views in debates current and future. This will be
accomplished through the construction of a conceptual framework into
which problems of resource description and organization can be situated
and understood. Along the way, you will work on hands-on exercises that
connect these concepts to practical problems. But you should view these
exercises not as skills to be developed, but as vehicles for improving
your understanding of principles and concepts.
:::

::: {#OBJECTIVES .SYLSEC}
Learning Objectives
-------------------

Your instructor hopes to learn more about your objectives for this
course. His own objectives include the following:

-   Disentangle levels of abstraction that are commonly blurred and
    confounded in the professional literature and discussion of resource
    organization and description.
-   Build a conceptual framework that will help equip students for more
    specialized IO/KR classes, and prepare them for inevitable future
    changes to descriptive standards and practices.
-   Confront the complexities arising from our colleagues\' conflicting
    philosophical commitments, and understand the very practical
    implications these basic world views have on our professional lives.
-   Engage in resource description exercises that will help make the
    concepts we read about and discuss more concrete, and provoke us to
    think about them more deeply.
:::

::: {#SYLLABUS .SYLSEC}
This Syllabus
-------------

The official syllabus for this course is the SGML version located at
<http://tinyurl.com/LIS590RO> . Expressions of the syllabus in other
formats are derived from the SGML version. The current SGML version
should be consulted to resolve any inconsistencies among other
renditions.
:::

::: {#INCLUSION .SYLSEC}
Statement of Inclusion
----------------------

The following expression is adopted from the Chancellor\'s Commitment
Statement of November 2012:

As the state\'s premier public university, the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign\'s core mission is to serve the interests of the
diverse people of the state of Illinois and beyond. The institution thus
values inclusion and a pluralistic learning and research environment,
one which we respect the varied perspectives and lived experiences of a
diverse community and global workforce. We support diversity of world
views, histories, and cultural knowledge across a range of social groups
including race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation,
abilities, economic class, religion, and their intersections.

::: {.SYLSUBSEC}
### Inclusiveness as a topic in LIS590-RO

The models and theories we cover in this class frame the way we
understand resources, our professional roles with respect to their
stewardship, and the access and preservation problems to which our
efforts are directed. Under the right circumstances they can help make
our services more inclusive, as we\'ve seen, for example, with the
digital encoding of writing systems and attention to web content
accessibility issues. But knowledge organization systems can also
marginalize, as reforms of library subject and medical classifications
have shown. The assignment and project requirements described below
provide flexibility for students to relate broader course objectives to
their own learning goals, interests, and current or prior professional
experience. Your instructor invites you to consider among those options
exploring issues such as:

-   The needs of underserved communities
-   Preservation of cultural heritage
-   Institutional bigotry in classification systems
-   Wealth and power distribution impacts on standards development

The readings and discussion topics for our class meetings are selected
with the aim of encouraging reflection and discussion, but those choices
are not socially or culturally neutral. Where we may be missing
opportunities to align the class content and conduct with the values
expressed in the inclusion statement, students are encouraged to call
classmate and instructor attention to those issues.
:::
:::

::: {#DISABILITY .SYLSEC}
Disability Statement
--------------------

To obtain disability-related academic adjustments and/or auxiliary aids,
students with disabilities must contact the course instructor and the
Disability Resources and Educational Services (DRES) as soon as
possible. To contact DRES you may visit 1207 S. Oak St., Champaign, call
217-333-4603 (V/TTY), or e-mail a message to disability\@uiuc.edu.
:::

::: {#GRADING .SYLSEC}
Basis for Grading and Evaluation
--------------------------------

The most important standards for success in a class like this one are
the educational goals that students bring to the class. Your instructor
hopes that the activities, assignments, and presentations planned for
this semester will be instrumental in your achieving the goals you set
for yourself. Each exercise and assignment has been selected to provide
an experience that will foster your own learning. Do not think that
grading and evaluative feedback are meant as assessments of your success
or failure in the class: they are provided as an incentive to engage
with the material to the best of your ability, and as a diagnostic to
ensure you\'re getting the benefits that the assignments should provide.

For students enrolled for four units, final grades will be calculated as
follows:

-   Graded homework assignments 40%
-   Term Project: 30%
-   Class Participation: 30%

For students enrolled for two units, final grades will be calculated as
follows:

-   Graded homework assignments 70%
-   Class Participation: 30%

::: {#FEEBACK .SYLSUBSEC}
### Evaluative and constructive feedback

Students are entitled to both evaluative and constructive feedback on
the assignments. Evaluative feedback reports how well a completed
assignment satisfied the requirements for a grade. Constructive feedback
provides more detailed criticism of the work, and suggestions for
improvement.
:::

::: {#HONESTY .SYLSUBSEC}
### On Adapting the Work of Others

Criteria for grading homework assignments include (but are not limited
to) creativity and the amount of original work demonstrated in the
assignment. However, students are permitted to use and adapt the work of
others, provided that the following guidelines are followed:

-   Use of other people\'s material must not infringe the copyright of
    the original author, nor violate the terms of any licensing
    agreement. Know and respect the principles of fair use with respect
    to copyrighted material.
-   Students must scrupulously attribute the original source and author
    of whatever material has been adapted for the assignment. Summarize
    the changes or adaptations that have been made. Make plain how much
    of the assignment represents original work.
:::

::: {#SUBMITTING .SYLSUBSEC}
### Submitting Assignments to the Instructor

All assignments must be submitted in machine readable form. The
instructor will discuss detailed requirements for file naming,
packaging, and submission for each assignment.
:::

::: {#ASSIGNMENTS .SYLSUBSEC}
### Graded Assignments

There will be seven graded homework assignments. Each one requires a
short essay one to five pages in length, with most of the content in
expressed in natural language, and some in a formal language or
standardized notation. The assignments are:

-   Resource domain/genre description (due January 26)
-   Ten resources for description (due February 9)
-   Five resource properties (due February 23)
-   Preliminary resource description in RDF (due March 15)
-   Property codomains and coded symbols (due March 29)
-   Entity identification and property domains (due April 12)
-   Updated resource description (due May 3)
:::

::: {#ASSIGNMENT1 .SYLSUBSEC}
### Assignment 1: resource domain/genre description

This assignment is due January 26. ( [upload
link](https://courses.lis.illinois.edu/mod/assign/view.php?id=228656){.WEBLINK}
)

In the next assignment, you will select ten (cultural or natural)
resources of your choice for analysis and description. Before doing so,
give some critical thought to the domain and/or genre from which you
will select them. Write a 1-3 page justification, focusing on the
characteristics of the domain or genre that you believe will make our
later exercises instructive for you. These characteristics might
include:

-   Your personal familiarity with and interest in the domain/genre.
-   Reasons people other than you have in locating and using resources
    of this kind. Competing or conflicting interests are often a good
    sign.
-   Problems with or limitations of current approaches to describing or
    classifying these kinds of resource.
-   Complexity of the resource (n.b., familiar resources are often more
    complex than meets the eye).

Please note that a domain or genre is not a topic. If you select
President Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865) as the domain for this assignment,
then for the next assignment you\'ll need to identify ten different
deceased U.S. presidents, each of whom was named Abraham Lincoln, and
each of whom lived from 1809 to 1865. Examples of more promising domains
include:

-   Journal articles in zoology
-   Your grandmother\'s postcard collection
-   Eighth century Byzantine coins
-   Prime numbers
-   Board games
-   Ethnographic data
-   Young adult novels
-   Mollusc shells

The aim of this assignment is to help you relate the topics in our
readings and discussions to concrete examples that you can explore in
the homework assignments.
:::

::: {#ASSIGNMENT2 .SYLSUBSEC}
### Assignment 2: ten resources for description

This assignment is due February 9. ( [upload
link](https://courses.lis.illinois.edu/mod/assign/view.php?id=228657){.WEBLINK}
)

Select ten cultural or natural resources, all drawn from the same
domain, type, or genre. In later assignments, you will analyze them with
respect to their properties, the relations they stand in with respect to
each other, and their identity conditions. For this assignment, write a
brief, one paragraph natural language description of each one. If your
choice of domain/genre in the last assignment was a mistake, include a
discussion of the new domain or genre. Let your choice of the ten be
guided by those characteristics you considered in assignment 1. In the
interests of making your later assignments more instructive, choose
resources that collectively exhibit diversity, highlight complexities,
and push against the limitations and problems of current descriptive
practice.

The aim of this assignment is to choose a small number of specific
resources that can serve as the focus for your thinking about and
applying the description and organization issues we discuss this
semester.
:::

::: {#ASSIGNMENT3 .SYLSUBSEC}
### Assignment 3: Five resource properties

This assignment is due February 23. ( [upload
link](https://courses.lis.illinois.edu/mod/assign/view.php?id=228658){.WEBLINK}
)

Choose five properties or relations that will serve as a basis for the
organization and description of your ten resources. Most or all of your
resources should have some value on that property (or stand in the
relation to another resource). But not every resource needs to exhibit
the property or stand in the relation. Some guidelines for choosing
properties/relations include:

-   Features that are of interest or concern to the communities who have
    a stake in the resource or its use.
-   Properties that have *discriminatory power* for your resources
    (i.e., those which highlight contrasts or divide the resources into
    categories.
-   Features that offer interesting or instructive descriptive problems

The aims of this assignment are to consider resource properties and
relations independently of how they are expressed or encoded in
descriptive records, and to consider the importance of properties\'
discriminatory power and interest to users in a specific context.
:::

::: {#ASSIGNMENT4 .SYLSUBSEC}
### Assignment 4: Preliminary resource description: property values

This assignment is due March 15. ( [upload
link](https://courses.lis.illinois.edu/mod/assign/view.php?id=228659){.WEBLINK}
)

Create valid RDF descriptions for your resources in terms of the
properties that you have identified. For this assignment use the turtle
serialization for RDF (see the [RDF
Primer](https://courses.ischool.illinois.edu/pluginfile.php/282255/mod_resource/content/5/ro16sp.html#manola_rdf_2007){.WEBLINK}
), and annotate the descriptions using natural language comments.

The aim of this assignment is to create a focus for more thorough
analysis of your properties in later assignments.
:::

::: {#ASSIGNMENT5 .SYLSUBSEC}
### Assignment 5: Property Codomains and coded symbols

This assignment is due March 29. ( [upload
link](https://courses.lis.illinois.edu/mod/assign/view.php?id=228660){.WEBLINK}
)

For each of the five properties or relations you identified in
assignment 3, give a precise, natural language account of that
property\'s codomain. That is to say, write a short description (in
careful English) of what kinds of things would serve as values on that
property or relation for entities in the property domain.

Next propose one or more strategies for denoting or encoding elements of
each codomain, or expressing surrogates for those elements.

The aim of this assignment is to consider expression or surrogation
choices independent of any particular descriptive standard or artificial
language.
:::

::: {#ASSIGNMENT6 .SYLSUBSEC}
### Assignment 6: Entity Identification and Property Domains

This assignment is due April 12. ( [upload
link](https://courses.lis.illinois.edu/mod/assign/view.php?id=228661){.WEBLINK}
)

For each of the five properties or relations you identified in
assignment 3, give a precise, natural language account of that
property\'s domain. That is to say, write a short description (in
careful English) of what kind of things can have that property.

Next write a brief analysis of how the domains of these properties
relate to each other, and make an attempt to propose identity conditions
for each type of thing.

The aim of this assignment is to attempt a discrimination among levels
of analysis for your resources, similar to the proposals we\'ve
considered for works, texts, and documents.
:::

::: {#ASSIGNMENT7 .SYLSUBSEC}
### Assignment 7: Description record syntax

This assignment is due May 3. ( [upload
link](https://courses.lis.illinois.edu/mod/assign/view.php?id=228662){.WEBLINK}
)

Create an updated, syntactically conforming expression of the
resource-property-value assignments from assignment 4 into a notation of
your choice. \"Syntactically conforming\" means a well-formed expression
that is governed by some grammar or schema. Choice (or invention) of the
particular grammar or schema should be documented in a few short
paragraphs that include a discussion of the choice/design as it relates
to the resources, their properties, and the audience for the encoded
records. If you chose an existing syntactic schema or specification,
include links or directions to its formal definition and documentation.
If you invent one of your own, include the definitions as a separate
attachment.

Examples of acceptable notations include (but are not limited to) the
following:

-   colloquial XML conforming to a [DTD or XML
    schema.](http://www.w3schools.com/xml/){.WEBLINK}
-   [RDF](https://courses.ischool.illinois.edu/pluginfile.php/282255/mod_resource/content/5/ro16sp.html#manola_rdf_2007){.WEBLINK}
    serialized in XML, or N3/Turtle.
-   strings conforming to a [regular or context-free
    grammar](http://marvin.cs.uidaho.edu/Teaching/CS445/grammar.html){.WEBLINK}

The aims of this assignment are to gain practice in the selection and
use of precise descriptive notation.
:::

::: {#PARTICIPATION .SYLSUBSEC}
### Attendance and Class Participation

The class participation grade is based on consistent attendance,
contribution to in-class and/or online discussions, and providing
assistance to classmates outside of class. Please alert the instructor
if a classmate has been of help to you outside of class. Class
participation also includes a required (but not graded) nomination of
three ICES questions for the final course evaluation. The instructor
will provide a link to the ICES question catalog. ( [upload
link](https://courses.lis.illinois.edu/mod/assign/view.php?id=228664){.WEBLINK}
) ( [ICES
Catalog](https://courses.ischool.illinois.edu/pluginfile.php/282255/mod_resource/content/5/ro16sp.html#uiuc_center_for_teaching_excellence_ices_2001){.WEBLINK}
)
:::

::: {#PROJECT .SYLSUBSEC}
### Term Project

Students enrolled for four units must complete a term project on a topic
approved by the course instructor. The term project is a work of
academic writing, approximately ten to twenty pages in length, exploring
a problem or issue in resource description (e.g., identity, derivation,
intentionality, etc.). Students are encouraged (not required) to frame
the project as a case study growing out of the earlier homework
assignments, but situated with respect to a broader and more general
review and analysis of the focal problem. Project proposals are due no
later than March 8, but students are encouraged to open a dialogue with
the instructor and with classmates well in advance of that date.
